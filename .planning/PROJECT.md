# mcp-trino-optimizer

## What This Is

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that helps Claude Code (and other MCP-compatible clients) optimize Trino SQL queries running against Iceberg data lakes. It analyzes queries using EXPLAIN / EXPLAIN ANALYZE evidence, applies a deterministic rule engine to diagnose performance issues, suggests prioritized optimizations with reasoning, and can safely rewrite SQL while preserving semantics. It is designed for data engineers, analytics engineers, and platform teams working with Trino + Iceberg.

## Core Value

Turn opaque Trino query performance problems into actionable, evidence-backed optimization reports that a user (or an LLM agent) can trust and apply safely.

## Requirements

- [x] Conflict resolution for overlapping rules (R1/D11, R2/R9, R5/R8) with considered-but-rejected audit trail
- [x] Audited narrative templates keyed by rule_id with identifier-only sanitization (prompt-injection defense verified)

### Out of Scope

<!-- Explicit boundaries. Includes reasoning to prevent re-adding. -->

- **Destructive or write SQL execution** — the server never issues `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `MERGE`, `DROP`, `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `TRUNCATE`, `CALL`, or DDL/DML of any kind. Read-only by construction; this is a safety guarantee.
- **JDBC driver support** — HTTP REST only for v1. JDBC pulls in JVM dependency and duplicates client code. Revisit only if users need Kerberos or complex auth.
- **Kerberos and mTLS authentication** — deferred; basic + JWT covers dev and most managed Trino (Starburst Galaxy, Ahana). Revisit per user request.
- **AWS Glue and Nessie (versioned) Iceberg catalogs** — deferred. Hive + REST covers the majority of deployments. Add when a user needs them.
- **Aggressive SQL rewrites that change semantics** — e.g., converting correlated subqueries to joins that alter null handling. Risk of silent correctness bugs is too high for an automated tool.
- **Cost-based optimizer replacement** — we advise and rewrite, we do not reimplement Trino's CBO.
- **Query editor / UI** — server only. Clients (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, custom) provide the interface.
- **Query execution beyond EXPLAIN / EXPLAIN ANALYZE / metadata reads** — no running of arbitrary user SELECTs for "preview" or result fetching.
- **Other query engines (Spark, Presto OSS, DuckDB, Snowflake)** — Trino + Iceberg is the focus. Code structure should make additional engines possible later but not this milestone.
- **Non-Iceberg table format rules** — Hive, Delta, Hudi rules are out of scope for v1. The rule engine architecture should allow them later.

## Context

- **Ecosystem**: Trino is the de facto query engine for open data lakes; Iceberg is the dominant open table format. Operators using Trino + Iceberg at scale frequently hit performance cliffs driven by missing stats, partition pruning failures, small-file explosions, and suboptimal join orders. Diagnosing these today requires deep expertise with EXPLAIN ANALYZE output.
- **MCP**: The Model Context Protocol is the emerging standard for giving LLM clients typed tools, resources, and prompts. Claude Code is a primary consumer. Building this as an MCP server (rather than a CLI) means the same capabilities are immediately available inside an agent loop.
- **Why now**: LLMs are credible at explaining plans and proposing rewrites, but they hallucinate without grounded evidence. This server provides the deterministic rule engine and real EXPLAIN output the LLM needs to be trustworthy.
- **Primary users**: Data engineers, analytics engineers, and platform teams already running Trino + Iceberg. Secondary: anyone using Claude Code who wants query-level optimization help without leaving their editor.
- **Design principle**: Deterministic rules first, LLM-assisted narrative second. The rule engine is the source of truth; prompts/resources shape how an LLM client presents the findings.

## Constraints

- **Tech stack**: Python 3.11+ with `uv` package manager, `pyproject.toml`, official `mcp` Python SDK, HTTP REST Trino client. No JVM dependency — Why: single-language simplicity, fast cold start, rich data tooling, and the strongest Python MCP ecosystem for this problem domain.
- **MCP transports**: Both `stdio` (for Claude Code / Desktop) and Streamable HTTP (for remote / hosted deployments) must work from day one — Why: user explicitly needs both local and remote workflows. (Note: legacy HTTP+SSE was deprecated in MCP spec 2025-03-26; Streamable HTTP is the correct implementation.)
- **Trino client**: HTTP REST only — Why: avoids JVM, keeps the server pure Python, works across all Trino versions.
- **Auth scope**: Basic + JWT bearer only — Why: covers open-source Trino and managed offerings without pulling in Kerberos/cert complexity.
- **Safety**: Read-only by default, no destructive SQL allowed, all executed queries logged — Why: the server is designed to be handed to an LLM agent; any hole becomes an exploit.
- **Packaging**: `uv` + `pyproject.toml` + Docker image — Why: reproducible dev, easy `pip install`, container-friendly deploy.
- **Testing**: Local docker-compose with Trino + Iceberg (REST catalog via Nessie or Lakekeeper) + MinIO — Why: real integration coverage without external dependencies; CI can run it.
- **Determinism**: Rule engine output must be deterministic given identical input — Why: reproducibility and auditability are non-negotiable for a tool LLMs will invoke.
- **Iceberg focus**: Rules and rewrites specifically target Iceberg semantics and metadata — Why: that is the target data platform; other formats are deferred.

## Key Decisions

<!-- Decisions that constrain future work. Add throughout project lifecycle. -->

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Python 3.11+ as the implementation language | Official MCP Python SDK maturity, mature `trino-python-client`, strong data tooling, avoids JVM | ✅ Confirmed — Python 3.12 used for Docker image; 3.11 is the floor |
| HTTP REST Trino client (no JDBC) | Keeps the server pure Python, no JVM, works across Trino versions | ✅ Confirmed — `trino-python-client` with async wrapper via `anyio.to_thread` |
| Dual execution mode: live + offline | Live gives grounded EXPLAIN evidence; offline lets users/LLMs analyze pasted plans without a cluster | ✅ Confirmed — `OfflinePlanSource` shares `PlanSource` port with live adapters |
| Basic + JWT auth only for v1 | Covers OSS Trino and major managed offerings without Kerberos/cert complexity | ✅ Confirmed — `BasicAuthentication` + `JWTAuthentication` in `SqlClassifier` auth builder |
| `uv` + `pyproject.toml` + Docker packaging | Reproducible dev, easy install via `pip`/`uvx`, containerized deploy path | ✅ Confirmed — `hatchling` build backend, multi-stage Dockerfile on `python:3.12-slim-bookworm` |
| Both `stdio` and Streamable HTTP MCP transports (not legacy HTTP+SSE) | User needs local (Claude Code) and remote/hosted use cases from day one | ✅ Confirmed — legacy SSE deprecated 2025-03-26; Streamable HTTP (`/mcp` endpoint) implemented |
| Hive + REST Iceberg catalogs first; Lakekeeper as the default REST catalog | Covers the dominant deployments; Glue/Nessie deferred | ✅ Confirmed — Lakekeeper chosen over Nessie/Polaris for simplest docker-compose story |
| Local docker-compose (Trino + Iceberg + MinIO) for integration tests | Real coverage in CI without external dependencies | ✅ Confirmed — Trino 480 + Lakekeeper + PostgreSQL + MinIO stack |
| Deterministic rule engine as source of truth; LLM prompts shape narrative only | Prevents hallucination; rules are auditable and testable | ✅ Confirmed — architecture locked in Phase 2 ports design |
| Safe-only SQL rewrites; never change semantics | Correctness is non-negotiable; an unsafe rewrite destroys trust | ✅ Confirmed — `dangerous_rewrites: false` default; whitelist-only transforms |
| Read-only by construction — no DDL/DML ever issued | Server will be invoked by LLM agents; blast radius must be bounded | ✅ Confirmed — `SqlClassifier` AST gate enforced at adapter boundary; invariant test in Phase 2 |
| Minimum supported Trino version: **429** | Balances feature availability vs. installed base | ✅ Confirmed — version probe on init; structured refusal below 429 |
| EXPLAIN ANALYZE is text-only (Trino issue #5786) — dual-path parser | Real Trino does not support `EXPLAIN ANALYZE (FORMAT JSON)`; text parsing required | ✅ Confirmed — discovered in Phase 3; dual-path parser architecture implemented |
